    history: "Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Its unique history blends Eastern and Western influences, creating a dynamic metropolis.  You’ve probably heard of the West Kowloon Cultural District by now — it’s home to some of Hong Kong’s newest and hottest art venues, museums and cultural landmarks, such as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, M+, Freespace, Art Park and Xiqu Centre. But did you know it’s also one of the best places to take in the stunning views of Victoria Harbour? After spending the morning immersed in art, history and culture, take a refreshing stroll along the waterside promenade; or better yet, pack a picnic basket to enjoy on one of the harbour-facing lawns — it’s a relaxing experience, and the sunsets here are unbeatable! ",
    culture: "Known for its vibrant food scene, traditional festivals, and bustling street markets, Hong Kong perfectly balances tradition with modernity. An age-old Chinese New Year ritual in Hong Kong, the first incense offering holds the promise of receiving extraordinary blessings for those fortunate enough to be the first to enter the temple. The event at the Wong Tai Sin Temple is the most sought after, and some worshippers would even dress up for the occasion.",
