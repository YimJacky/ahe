    history: "Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Its unique history blends Eastern and Western influences, creating a dynamic metropolis.  You’ve probably heard of the West Kowloon Cultural District by now — it’s home to some of Hong Kong’s newest and hottest art venues, museums and cultural landmarks, such as the Hong Kong Palace Museum, M+, Freespace, Art Park and Xiqu Centre. But did you know it’s also one of the best places to take in the stunning views of Victoria Harbour? After spending the morning immersed in art, history and culture, take a refreshing stroll along the waterside promenade; or better yet, pack a picnic basket to enjoy on one of the harbour-facing lawns — it’s a relaxing experience, and the sunsets here are unbeatable! ",
    culture: "Known for its vibrant food scene, traditional festivals, and bustling street markets, Hong Kong perfectly balances tradition with modernity. An age-old Chinese New Year ritual in Hong Kong, the first incense offering holds the promise of receiving extraordinary blessings for those fortunate enough to be the first to enter the temple. The event at the Wong Tai Sin Temple is the most sought after, and some worshippers would even dress up for the occasion.",

Rome: {
    name: "Rome",
    history: "From the conquest of the Mediterranean beginning in the third century BC to the destruction of the Roman Empire at the hands of barbarian invaders some seven centuries later, we discover the most critical episodes in Roman history: the spectacular collapse of the 'free' republic, the birth of the age of the 'Caesars', the violent suppression of the strongest rebellion against Roman power, and the bloody civil war that launched Christianity as a world religion.   At the heart of this account are the dynamic, complex but flawed characters of some of the most powerful rulers in history: men such as Pompey the Great, Julius Caesar, Augustus, Nero and Constantine.",
    culture: "Although the Romans were heavily influenced by ancient Greece, they were able to make improvements to certain borrowed Greek designs and inventions. For example, they continued the use of columns, but the form became more decorative and less structural in Roman buildings. Ancient Romans created curved roofs and large-scale arches, which were able to support more weight than the post-and-beam construction the Greeks used. These arches served as the foundation for the massive bridges and aqueducts the Romans created. The game-loving ancients also built large amphitheaters, including the Colosseum. The sports stadiums we see today, with their oval shapes and tiered seating, derive from the basic idea the Romans developed.",
